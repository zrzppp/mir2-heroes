[@Q707]
Methods of using magic can be different, the master puts\
the mouse over the monster's body, then presses the corresponding\
keyboard button (F1-F8) depending on what magic is set. For Taoists\
and Warriors basic sword techniques do not need to have a button set\
and will level themselves when you fight.\ \

[@Q707_1]
To get to WoomyonWoods, exit from the north city gate. Go along the\
right-hand side river bank, so you can see the seacoast, walk upwards,\
you will see archers and a fence, enter there. You must find the shop\
boss after the archer in there, tell her my recent situation.\
This road can be difficult, You could run into a fierce monster like a\
Oma Warrior or something else, you must be careful, Good luck..\ \
