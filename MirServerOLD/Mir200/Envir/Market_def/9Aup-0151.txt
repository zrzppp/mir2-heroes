Welcome to my shop <$USERNAME>\
My work is so skilled that even members of\
<$OWNERGUILD> cannot be offered a discount.\
It hurts my Pride!\ \
<Upgrade Weapon/@upgrade>\
<Get Back Upgraded Weapon/@getbackupgnow>\
<Close/@exit>\

[@upgrade]
I can upgrade weapons for you for a small fee of\
<$UPGRADEWEAPONFEE>. To make an Upgrade you need\
<BlackOre/@Biron>, <Jewelery/@Etc>,\
<Weapon/@Weapon>, and <Gold/@Gold>.\
Do you have these ready for me?\ \
<Confirm Upgrade/@confirmupgrade>\
<Cancel Upgrade/@main>\

[@Biron]
BlackOre is a strong metal used for making weapons.\
BlackOre can be obtained from the mines, the higher\
the purity, the better chance of a good upgrade.\
My eyesight is poor, so i will take all BlackOre\
that is in your Bag\ \
<Back/@upgrade>

[@Etc]
Jewelery are items such as Necklaces, Bracelets and\
Rings. The higher level needed to wear, the better\
the chance of the refine working. My eyesight is not\
very good, so i will take all jewelery from your bag\ \
<Back/@upgrade>

[@Weapon]
The weapon I will use is the weapon that is in your hand at \
the time of the request.\ \
<Back/@upgrade>

[@Gold]
I can't upgrade your weapon for free. As my work is of\
such a high standard i charge <$UPGRADEWEAPONFEE> per\
upgrade.\\
<Back/@upgrade>

[@confirmupgrade]
I will take your <$USERWEAPON> from you to refine.\
My eysight isn't very good so I will take \
all the BlackOre and Jewelery in your bag.\
If you do have items you do not want included you\
must store them now\ \

[~@upgradenow_ok]
It was hard but I think I have done a good job.\ \
<Get back weapon now/@getbackupgnow>\
<Collect weapon later/@main>

[~@upgradenow_ing]
I am already working on an item for you\
Come back later...\ \
<Back/@main>\

[~@upgradenow_fail]
Hey <$USERNAME>. Are you trying to confuse me?\
You are missing one or more of the vital ingredients\
Check you are wearing a weapon, have the BlackOre, Jewelery\
and most importantly the money.\
Then try again\ \
<Back/@main>

[~@getbackupgnow_ok]
Here is your weapon.\
I have done my best.\
You need to try the weapon to see if the upgrade was successful\
<More Information/@Success>\ \
<Ok/@exit>

[@Success]
I can't guarrantee successfull refining each and every time.\
You will need to check yourself to see if it worked.\ \
<Ok/@exit>

[~@getbackupgnow_ing]
The upgrade is not finished yet, come back later!\ \
<Ok/@main>

[~@getbackupgnow_fail]
If you gave me a weapon a long time ago, you can forget about it now!\
You should have come back sooner!\ \
<Ok/@main>
