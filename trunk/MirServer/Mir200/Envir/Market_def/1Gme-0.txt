<$USERNAME> I will give you a guide on collecting the meat\
that I need. The method is to shear the meat.\ \

#SAY
First find a hen, sheep, deer or wolf. Kill the monster, hold alt\
+ click on the monster, and you may obtain some meat. Press F9\
(Opens bag) and see what quality meat you got. I need quality\
13 or above.\
That is what I need you to do.\

[@sell]
We'll buy high quality at high price.\
But we'll buy at low price meat stained with soil or burned by fire.\ \
<Back/@main>

[@meathelp]
Meat can be gained from Hens, Deer, Sheep, and Wolves.\
To get meat from any of the above, first of all kill the animal.\
Once you have killed it, press the ALT button, while left clicking\
on the dead body for a few seconds.\
You should then see a piece of meat appear in your inventory.\
Using magic to kill an animal burns the meat, reducing its quality.\ \
