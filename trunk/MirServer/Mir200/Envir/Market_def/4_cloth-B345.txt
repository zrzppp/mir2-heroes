[@talk]
This castle was built to be used as a base to defeat the\
Monsters around Woomyon Forest. So after the construction\
was completed, many people were forced to settle down here.\
But.....\
we are far from defeating the monsters and we are instead\
surrounded by them so the situation is reversed.\ \
