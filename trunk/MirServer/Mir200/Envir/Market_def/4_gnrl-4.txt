Oh! Welcome, What are you looking for?\
There is a wide variety of useful goods here.\
Please have a look.\ \

[@buy]
Everything I sell here may look meagre but\
they are all necessary things.\
Ok, What do you want to buy?\ \
<Back/@main>

[@sell]
Oh what a coincidence!\
I was just about to order some more goods since\
the stock is running low.\
What do you want to sell?\ \
<Back/@main>

[@talk]
This is such an isolated place - goods are usually scarce.\
It's people like me who keep helping to maintain some prosperity\
here by importing goods from outside. Heh heh heh..\ \
