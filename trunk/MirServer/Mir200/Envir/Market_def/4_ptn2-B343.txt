Cough.. cough.., welcome.\
I'm too old to climb a mountain to collect herbs.\
So I'm here just selling potions for a living.\
See anything you want to buy?\

For warriors, who live by their swords; Health drugs\
are a necessity for sustaining life.\
Be sure to carry enough.\ \ \

What do you want to sell?\
Let me have a look.\
You wouldn't sell me a rotten drug, would you?\ \ \

No medicinal herb is 100% good or bad.\
If it suits your body type, symptom and the season,\
it's a good drug. However, those ignorant souls\
are always in pursuit of rare herbs to enhance\
their power.. I really do pity them. You should\
not do such a vain thing as it can be dangerous,\
just practice hard and you will be rewarded.\ \
